🍬 Gulab Jamun Recipe
Servings: 20–25 small pieces
Preparation Time: 20 minutes
Cooking Time: 30 minutes

Ingredients
For the Gulab Jamun Balls:
1 cup milk powder

¼ cup all-purpose flour (maida)

2 tablespoons semolina (sooji/rava)

½ teaspoon baking soda

2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)

¼ cup milk (warm, adjust as needed to make a soft dough)

Ghee or oil for deep frying

For the Sugar Syrup:
1½ cups sugar

1½ cups water

4–5 cardamom pods (crushed)

1 teaspoon rose water (optional, for fragrance)

Few strands of saffron (optional)

1 teaspoon lemon juice (to prevent crystallization)

Instructions
1. Prepare the Sugar Syrup:
In a pan, add sugar and water. Heat on medium flame.

Stir until sugar dissolves completely.

Add cardamom pods, rose water, saffron, and lemon juice.

Simmer for 8–10 minutes. The syrup should be slightly sticky but not thick.

Turn off the heat and keep it warm.

2. Make the Dough:
In a mixing bowl, add milk powder, all-purpose flour, semolina, and baking soda. Mix well.

Add ghee and rub with fingers to make a crumbly texture.

Gradually add warm milk, little by little, and knead into a soft, smooth dough.

Let the dough rest for 5–10 minutes.

3. Shape the Balls:
Divide the dough into small equal portions.

Roll them into smooth balls without cracks (important to avoid breaking while frying).

4. Fry the Jamuns:
Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan on low to medium heat.

Add a few dough balls at a time and fry gently. Keep stirring so they brown evenly.

Fry until golden brown on all sides. This may take 7–8 minutes.

Remove and drain excess oil.

5. Soak in Syrup:
Immediately drop the fried jamuns into the warm sugar syrup.

Let them soak for at least 2–3 hours. They will expand and become soft.

✅ Tips:
Don’t fry on high heat; jamuns may burn outside and stay raw inside.

Ensure the syrup is warm but not hot while adding jamuns.

You can garnish with chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds before serving.










Instructions
1. Soak Sabja Seeds:
Wash and soak sabja (basil) seeds in ½ cup water for 15–20 minutes.

They will swell and become gelatinous. Drain excess water and set aside.

2. Prepare Falooda Sev:
If using ready-made sev:

Boil water and cook sev according to package instructions (usually 3–5 minutes).

Drain and rinse with cold water. Set aside.

If using regular vermicelli:

Break into small pieces, boil until soft, then rinse in cold water.

3. Sweeten the Milk:
In a bowl, mix sugar with chilled milk.

Stir until completely dissolved. Keep milk cold in the refrigerator.

4. Assemble the Falooda:
Use tall glasses for best presentation.

Add 1 tablespoon rose syrup at the bottom of the glass.

Add 1–2 tablespoons soaked sabja seeds.

Add 2–3 tablespoons falooda sev.

Pour sweetened chilled milk over the layers until the glass is ¾ full.

Add a scoop of ice cream on top.

Drizzle a little more rose syrup.

Garnish with chopped nuts, cherries, or tutti frutti.

✅ Tips:
Use rose syrup for the classic flavor, but you can try kesar, mango, or chocolate syrup for variations.

For a richer version, use evaporated milk or rabri.

You can also add jelly cubes or fruit bits for a twist
